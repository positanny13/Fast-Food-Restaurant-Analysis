### PROJECT OVERVIEW
### This project analyzes sales transactions from a local restaurant, providing valuable insights into the restaurant's operations and customer behavior. The dataset includes information such as order ID, transaction date, item names, item types (categorized as Fastfood or Beverages), item prices, quantities ordered, transaction amounts, transaction types (cash, online, or others), the gender of the staff member who received the order, and the time of sale (Morning, Evening, Afternoon, Night, Midnight).

### The main objectives of this project are:

1. Identify the most frequently ordered item.
2. Determine the top 5 items by revenue.
3. Analyze peak sales periods to optimize staffing and inventory management.
4. Compare revenue generated by different item types (Fastfood vs. Beverages) and identify trends over time.
5. Investigate if the gender of staff handling transactions affects sales volume.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to understand the dataset and uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships within the data
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values and ensured data consistency.
Visualization: Created bar plots to visualize peak sales periods and pie charts to compare revenue by item type.
Correlation Analysis: Examined the relationship between staff gender and sales volume.
